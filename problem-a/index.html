    <h1>Thomas Jasper Cat Sr.</h1>
    <img src="img/tom.png" alt="This is an image of Tom">
    <p>This is Tom from the famous kids TV show <cite><a href="https://tomandjerry.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry_Wiki">Tom and Jerry</a></cite>. Many times we find Tom and Jerry fooling around and breaking things. The episodes usually end with good morals that growing kids can take away, but they are always funny to watch regardless of ones age. Me personally, I enojy the Tom and Jerry Classics, but there have been episodes and movies under generations of different directors.</p>
